# Procedural Design Scratch Workspace

A scratch workspace for procedural generation experiments focusing on organic forms and reaction-diffusion patterns.

## Structure

This workspace contains:
- `procedural-design/` - Main project folder with all experiments, source code, and outputs

## Quick Start

Navigate to the main project:
```bash
cd procedural-design
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

For detailed documentation, see [procedural-design/README.md](procedural-design/README.md)

## Current Experiments

- Gray Scott Vase: Reaction-diffusion patterns applied to vessel forms
- Space Colonisation Perforated Moss Pole: Organic growth patterns on cylindrical structures
- Various archived experiments in `procedural-design/notebooks/archived_experiments/`
